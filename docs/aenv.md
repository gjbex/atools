# Getting your parameters: `aenv`
The parameters for tasks can be stored in an CSV file, where the first
row is simply the names of the parameters, and each consecutive row
represents the values of these parameters for a specific experiment, i.e.,
computational task.

`aenv` will use the task identifier as an index into this CSV file, and
define environment variables with the appropriate values for that task.
As an example, consider the following PBS script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
...
alpha=0.5
beta=-1.3
Rscript bootstrap.R $alpha $beta
...
```
However, this approach would lead to as many job scripts are there are
parameter instances, which is inconvenient to say the least.

This computation would have to be done for many values for `alpha` and
`beta`.  These values can be represented in an CSV file, `data.csv`:
```
alpha,beta
0.5,-1.3
0.5,-1.5
0.5,-1.9
0.6,-1.3
...
```
The job script can be modified to automatically define the appropriate
values for `alpha` and `beta` specific for the task.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
...
source <(aenv --data data.csv)
Rscript bootstrap.R $alpha $beta
...
```
`aenv` will use the value of the task identifier to read the corresponding
row in the `data.csv` CSV file, and export the variables `alpha` and `beta`
with those values.

`aenv` has a number of options that can be useful in some situations.

1. `--sniff <nr_bytes>`: the number of bytes used to determine the CSV
    dialect.  It may be useful to increase this from the default value of
    1024 bytes for files with many columns, or large line lengths.
1. `--no_sniffer` : for data files with a single column, the sniffer
    gets confused, so it should be switched off.
1. `--id <id>`: used to specify your own line number in the CSV file to
    determine the variables' values.  This can be used in conjunction with
    a queue system or scheduler that `atools` doesn't currently support.
    This defaults to the task identifier as set by the queue system or
    scheduler.
1. `--shell bash|sh|tcsh|csh`: shell syntax generated by `aenv`, defaults
    to bash/sh.
1. `--conf <config-file>`: use the specified configuration file, rather
    than the default one.

Help on the command is printed using the `--help` flag.
